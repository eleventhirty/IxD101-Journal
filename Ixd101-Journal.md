### PLANE STUDY

In my first workshop week we had a look at design using planes.  This was a follow up to the study of dot and line carried out in previous weeks and whilst at first the subject may have seemed a little primitive, going back to basics was the perfect way to ease me into a creative mindspace suitable for IxD.

This is what we came up with;

+ 1 plane - 20 boxes
+ 2 planes - 1 box
